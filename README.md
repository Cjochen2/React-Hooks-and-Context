# React-Hooks-and-Context
A small simple project for increasing my understanding of React Hooks as well as gaining a stronger understanding of state management utilizing Context. My main focus with this application was just working through the logic of how Context works in terms of state management and revisiting the use of Hooks in place of classes.

The tutorial video and explination I used to create this application can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35lXWvCuM8o&list=PLTbRa7jhMhekNoZy3PXVZsm8WktpitCvp&index=3&t=956s
